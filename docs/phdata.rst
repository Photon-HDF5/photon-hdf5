Photon-HDF5 format definition
=============================

.. contents::

Overview
--------

A Photon-HDF5 is a HDF5 file with a predefined structure for timestamp-based
data.

A screen-shot of a typical Photon-HDF5 file opened in HDFView is shown here:

.. figure:: /images/hdfview.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400px
    :alt: HDView screenshot showing a Photon-HDF5 file

The previous figure shows the 5 main groups contained in a Photon-HDF5 file.
Of these, :ref:`/photon_data/<photon_data_group>` and  :ref:`/setup/<setup_group>`
contains the raw data and all the information needed for the analysis.
A schematic overview is shown in the next figure:

.. figure:: /images/format-diagram_first2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Photon-HDF5 structure: photon_data, setup

The remaining 3 groups provide additional metadata not necessary for data
analysis:

.. figure:: /images/format-diagram_last3.png
    :align: center
    :alt: Photon-HDF5 structure: sample, identity, provenance

A brief description of these 3 metadata groups follows:

- :ref:`/identity/<identity_group>`:
  Information about the data file.

- :ref:`/provenance/<provenance_group>`:
  Information about the original data file (when the Photon-HDF5 file
  has been converted from another format).

- :ref:`/sample/<sample_group>`:
  Description of the measured sample.

Finally, the group :ref:`/user/<user_group>` may be included to store
additional data not defined in the Photon-HDF5 spec.
Unlike all other groups, the contents of the ``/user/`` group are not
rigidly defined. However, guidelines are provided for how data should
be stored and what should be included.

.. note::
    Since the format of the :ref:`/user/<user_group>` group is not rigid, it will be ignored
    by official readers.


.. _root_params:

Root-level parameters
---------------------

The root node ("/") in a Photon-HDF5 file contains the following fields:

- **/acquisition_duration**: (float) the measurement duration in seconds.
- **/description**: (string) a user-defined measurement description.

In addition, the root node has the following attributes which
distinguish a Photon-HDF5 file from other HDF5 files:

- **/format_name**: (string) must contain the string "Photon-HDF5"
- **/format_version**: (string) the Photon-HDF5 format version.


.. _photon_data_group:

Photon-data group
-----------------

This section describes the layout and fields in the ``/photon_data/`` group.
Note that only the kind of data is specified (i.e. scalar (float or integer),
integer array, float array), but no data type size is mandated.
For arrays, the most commonly used data-type is indicated.

.. note::
    In multi-spot measurements each spot is represented in a separate group
    named sequentially ``photon_data0``, ``photon_data1`` ...

    See :ref:`multi_spot` for more details.

Mandatory fields:

- **timestamps**: (integer array) photon timestamps. Typical data-type int64.
- **timestamps_specs/**
    - **timestamps_unit**: (float) timestamp units in *seconds*.

Optional if there is only 1 detector, otherwise mandatory:

- **detectors**: (integer array) :ref:`detector IDs<detector_ids>` for each timestamp.
  Must be the same length as ``timestamps``. Typical data-type uint8.

When the dataset contains TCSPC or nanotime information (i.e. arrival time of each
photon with respect to a laser pulse), the following
fields must be present:

- **nanotimes**: (integer array) TCSPC nanotimes. Conventionally the time
  axis direction is the "natural" direction, i.e. lifetime decays look
  correctly oriented in time. Must be the same length as ``timestamps``
  For more details see :ref:`nanotimes_time_axis`.
  Typical data-type uint16.
- **nanotimes_specs/**
    - **tcspc_unit**: (float) TAC/TDC bin size (in seconds).
      In official photon-HDF5 readers, this field is used for determining resolution of nanotimes.
      Other fields in ``nanotimes_specs`` are ignored if not needed.
    - **tcspc_num_bins**: (integer) number of TAC/TDC bins.
    - **tcspc_range**:(float) (*Optional*) full-scale range of the TAC/TDC (in seconds).
      This a derived field equal to ``tcspc_unit * tcspc_num_bins``.

.. note::

    In the unusual case where detectors in a single spot do not share the same
    settings, then ``nanotimes_specs`` should be omitted and the data
    exclusively stored in the equivalent fields in ``/setup/detectors/`` where
    per-detector settings can be stored. Doing so will mean readers of <v0.5 will
    not be able to read the file.

Finally, if the data come from a simulation, ``/photon_data/`` may contain:

-  **particles**: (integer array) a particle ID (integer) for each
   timestamp. Typical data-type uint8.

.. _measurement_specs_group:

Measurement specs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The group ``/photon_data/measurement_specs/`` group contains additional
information allowing inference regarding the interpretation of the data
for each specific type of measurement.

- **measurement_type**: (string) the type of the measurements. Valid names
  are:

    - "generic" a generic measurement defined by fields in ``/setup``
      and ``measurement_specs``.
    - "smFRET" (1 excitation wavelengths, 2 detection spectral bands). If
      ``/setup/lifetime`` is True the measurement also includes TCSPC nanotimes.
    - "smFRET-usALEX" (2 excitation wavelengths, 2 detection colors)
    - "smFRET-usALEX-3c" (3 excitation wavelengths, 3 detection colors)
    - "smFRET-nsALEX" (2 pulsed-laser wavelengths, 2 detection colors)

The ``measurement_type`` field describes the type of measurement
saved within the file. A "specific" measurement type can mandate
the presence of certain fields in ``measurement_specs/`` and certain
fields match particular values in ``/setup/``
(see also :ref:`measurement_type`).

In Photon-HDF5 <0.5, each type of measurement required a distinct
``measurement_type``, which was inconvenient for supporting
many variants of common measurements. In Photon-HDF5 0.5+
we added a :doc:`"generic" measurement type <generic>` which supports
an arbitrary range of setup configurations. In this case, values
in :ref:`/setup/ <setup_group>` will determine the
mandatory fields in the :ref:`measurement_specs/ <measurement_specs_group>` group.
The "generic" measurement type is recommended to be used in most cases
as it covers all other types possible within the photon-HDF5 spec.

If you feel that a new "specific" measurement type would be especially
useful to add for your application we have :doc:`instructions <new_measurement_specs>`
to propose a new one.

The following ``measurement_specs`` fields are used to specify key values for
determining to which photon stream a given photon belongs when using
alternated/interleaved excitation (both continuous wave and pulsed excitation).

For continuous wave excitation with any number of colors:

- **alex_period**: (integer or float) [μs-ALEX only] duration of one complete
  excitation alternation period expressed in *timestamp units*. The alternation
  period is equal to ``alex_period * timestamps_unit``.

- **alex_offset**: (scalar) [μs-ALEX only] Time offset (in timestamps units)
  to be applied to the timestamps array before computing the μs-ALEX histogram.
  It is assumed that the μs-ALEX alternation histogram is the histogram of
  (``timestamps`` - ``alex_offset``) **MOD** ``alex_period``.

When ``photon_data/nanotimes`` is present the following is mandatory:

- **laser_repetition_rate**: (float) excitation laser pulse repetition rate
  in *Hertz*.

For alternated excitation experiments (e.g. μs-ALEX and ns-ALEX), the following
fields are used to specify the alternation period:

- **alex_excitation_period1**: (integer array with an even-number of
  elements, normally 2) start and stop value(s) identifying the excitation
  period(s) for the **first** wavelength in ``/setup/excitation_wavelengths``
  (which is the shortest wavelength). Indexing of start and stop value(s)
  starts from 0, and the period is defined as [start, stop).
  In smFRET experiments with 2-colors excitation this field defines the
  *donor excitation period*.
  See also :ref:`wavelengths_order` and note below.

- **alex_excitation_period2**: (integer array with an even-number of
  elements, normally 2) start and stop values identifying the excitation
  periods for the **second** wavelength in ``/setup/excitation_wavelengths``.
  In smFRET experiments with 2-colors excitation this field defines the
  *acceptor excitation period*.
  See also :ref:`wavelengths_order` and note below.

For 3 (or more) colors alternated or interleaved excitation:

- **alex_excitation_period3**: (integer array with an even-number of
  elements, normally 2) start and stop values identifying the excitation
  periods for the **third** wavelength in ``/setup/excitation_wavelengths``.
  See also :ref:`wavelengths_order` and note below.

- etc...

.. note::

    For μs-ALEX, both *alex_excitation_period1* and *alex_excitation_period2*
    are 2-element arrays and are expressed in *timestamps units* as defined in
    ``timestamps_specs/timestamps_unit``.
    For ns-ALEX (also known as PIE), they are arrays with an even-number
    of elements, comprising as many start-stop nanotime pairs as
    there are excitation periods within the TAC/TDC range.
    In this case the values are expressed in *nanotimes units* as defined in
    ``nanotimes_specs/tcspc_unit``. If their is a single pair of start-stop
    times, then the array should be 1D, but if multiple start-stop pairs are
    specified, it is preferable to specify each pair in a separate row, thus
    resulting in a 2D array of shape Nx2. If the array is 1D official readers
    will tread ever consecutive pair of points as a separate start-stop pair.

    For more details see :ref:`alex_period_def`.

.. _detectors_specs_group:

Detectors specs
"""""""""""""""

Within ``measurement_specs/``, the ``detectors_specs/`` sub-group
contains all the :ref:`detector ID<detector_ids>`--event
associations, i.e. spectral bands,
polarizations, :ref:`beam-split channels<beam_split_ch>`,
and non-photon events.

When a measurement records more than 1 spectral band, the fields:

- **spectral_ch1**
- **spectral_ch2**
- etc...

specify which detector is employed in each spectral band. When the
measurement records only 1 spectral band these fields may be omitted. The
spectral bands are strictly ordered for increasing wavelengths.
For example, for 2-color smFRET measurements
``spectral_ch1`` and ``spectral_ch2`` represent the
*donor* and *acceptor* channel respectively.

If a measurement records more than 1 polarization state, the fields:

- **polarization_ch1**
- **polarization_ch2**
- etc...

specify which detector ID is used for each polarization. When the measurement
records only one polarization, these fields may be omitted.

When the detection light is split into 2 channels using a non-polarizing
beam-splitter the fields:

- **split_ch1**
- **split_ch2**
- etc..

specify which detector ID is used in each of the "beam-split" channels.

If :ref:`non-photon IDs <non_photon_ids>` are also recorded, then the fields (*new in v0.5*):

- **non_photon_id1**
- **non_photon_id2**
- etc...

are used to categorize each non-photon id. Currently there are no specifications
for the type of markers. These should be explained in
the :ref:`/user/experimental_settings<exp_settings>` group for human readable
understanding enabling *custom* code to be written to process these detector IDs.
All official software for v0.5 will ignore data points specified as non-photon IDs.
Future releases may specify sorts of measurements that will have defined uses
for particular non-photon IDs.


.. note::

    Use of :ref:`non-photon IDs <non_photon_ids>` is discouraged as their purpose
    is defined in the :ref:`/user/experimental_settings<exp_settings>` group,
    and thus lack an internal definition. Additionally, the use of non-photon ids
    may cause poorly implemented readers designed for <v0.5 to incorrectly interpret
    the data. Therefore include non-photon ids only if absolutely necessary.
    Otherwise it is preferable to remove them from the data stream to make 
    interpretation of the data unambiguous.


All previous fields are arrays containing one or more :ref:`detector IDs<detector_ids>`
(Detector IDs for all ``spectral_chX``, ``polarization_ch1`` and ``split_chX``,
and :ref:`non-photon IDs <non_photon_ids>` for ``non_photon_chX``).
If a given experiment type does not involve a given field type, that field should
be omitted. For example, a 2-color smFRET measurement without polarization or split
channels (2 detectors) will have only one value in ``spectral_ch1`` (donor) and one
value in ``spectral_ch2`` (acceptor). A 2-color smFRET measurement with polarization
(4 detectors) will have 2 values in each of the ``spectral_chX`` and
``polarization_chX`` fields (where X=1 or 2).
For a multispot smFRET measurement, in each ``/photon_dataX/`` group,
there will be ``spectral_chX`` fields containing the donor/acceptor detector IDs
(pixels) used in that spot (see :ref:`multi_spot`).


.. _setup_group:

Setup group
-----------

The ``/setup/`` group contains information about the measurement setup.
This group can be **absent** in some files, an example being
a file containing only detector dark counts, for which the following
fields do not necessarily have a meaning.
When setup is present, the following 9 fields are mandatory:

- **num_spectral_ch**: (integer) number of distinct detection spectral
  channels. For example, in a simple 2-color smFRET experiment there are 2
  detection spectral channels (donor and acceptor), therefore its value is 2.
  When there is a single detection channel or all channels detect
  the same spectral band, its value is 1.
  There should be equivalent number of ``spectral_chX`` fields in each
  ``/photon_data/measurement_specs/detectors_specs`` group.

- **num_polarization_ch**: (integer) number of distinct detection polarization
  channels. For example, in polarization anisotropy measurements, its value
  is 2.
  When there is a single detection channel or all channels detect
  the same polarization (including when no polarization selection is performed)
  its value is 1.
  There should be equivalent number of ``polarization_chX`` fields in each
  ``/photon_data/measurement_specs/detectors_specs`` group.

- **num_split_ch**: (integer) number of distinct detection channels
  detecting the same spectral band **and** polarization state. For example,
  when a non-polarizing beam-splitter is employed in the detection path,
  its value is 2. When no splitting
  is performed, its value is 1.
  There should be equivalent number of ``split_chX`` fields in each
  ``/photon_data/measurement_specs/detectors_specs/`` group.

- **num_spots**: (integer) the number of excitation (or detection)
  "spots" in the sample. This field is 1 for all the measurements using a
  single confocal excitation volume.
  If field is greater than 1 there should be equivalent number of
  ``/photon_dataX/`` groups (see :ref:`multi_spot`)

- **num_pixels**: (integer) total number of detector ids. For example,
  for a single-spot 2-color smFRET measurement using 2 single-pixel SPADs as
  detectors this field is 2. This field is normally equal to
  ``num_pixels = num_spectral_ch * num_split_ch * num_polarization_ch * num_spot``.
  This equation is not valid when the optical setup has non-symmetric branches,
  for example if the emission path is split in two spectral bands and only
  one of the two is further split in two polarizations.
  This only counts actual detectors that produces photon IDs, and does not
  include :ref:`non-photon IDs <non_photon_ids>`.

- **excitation_cw**: (array of booleans) for each excitation source,
  this field indicates whether excitation is continuous wave (CW), *True*,
  or pulsed, *False*.
  The order of excitation sources is the same as that in
  ``excitation_wavelengths`` and is in increasing order of wavelengths.

- **lifetime**: (boolean) *True* (or 1) if the measurements includes a
  ``photon_data/nanotimes`` array of (usually sub-ns resolution) photon
  arrival times with respect to a laser pulse (as in TCSPC measurements).

- **modulated_excitation**: (boolean) *True* (or 1) if there is any form of
  excitation modulation either in the wavelength space (as in μs-ALEX or PAX)
  or in the polarization space. This field is also *True* for
  pulse-interleaved excitation (PIE/ns-ALEX) measurements.

- **excitation_alternated**: (array of booleans) *New in version 0.5.*
  For each excitation source,
  this field indicates whether the excitation is alternated (True) or
  not alternated (False). In ALEX measurement all sources are alternated.
  In PAX measurements only one of the two sources is alternated.
  In measurements with pulsed-interleaved excitation (PIE/ns-ALEX) , this field
  should contain all False.

.. _detectors_group:

Detectors group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*New in version 0.5.* The group ``/setup/detectors/``
contains arrays with one element per detector (detector ID).
This group may be **absent** *if* the :ref:`/photon_data/<photon_data_group>` group(s) do **not** contain ``detectors`` arrays.
The allowed fields are:

    - **id** (integer array): *Mandatory.* Number used by in
      ``/photon_data/detectors`` to identify the :ref:`detector ID <detector_ids>`.

    - **id_hardware** (integer array): *Optional.* Detector numbers as used by the
      acquisition hardware if different from ``id``.
    - **spot** (integer array): *Multispot only, mandatory.* The spot number each
      detector ID is used in. If present, must be of the same length as ``id``.
    - **label** (array of string): *Optional.* A human-readable label for each detector ID, including non-photon IDs.
      If present, must be of the same length as ``id``.
    - **module** (array of string): *Multispot only, optional.* Name of the module each

      positions of each spot in the array. Must be of the length specified
      in ``num_spots``.
    - **tcspc_unit:** (float array) array of TAC/TDC bin size (in seconds).
      Present only if ``/setup/lifetime`` is True and if TCSPC info is different
      for each detector. If present, must be of the same length as ``id``.
      This value should be 0 for positions corresponding to marker IDs
    - **tcspc_num_bins:** (integer array) array of number of TAC/TDC bins. Present
      only if ``/setup/lifetime`` is True and if TCSPC info is different
      for each detector. If present, must be of the same length as ``id``.
      This value should be 0 for positions corresponding to 0 for marker ids.
    - **tcspc_offset:** (integer array) *Optional* Offset per record ID (as in ``id``) to add to
      nanotime to account for speed of light delays between detectors. When using pulsed
      interleaved excitation, the nanotimes window for a given detector is defined by
      ``/photon_data/measurement_specs/alex_excitation_periodX + tcspc_offset``. Should be 0
      for at least 1 :ref:`photon ID<detector_ids>`, and default 0 for :ref:`non-photon IDs<non_photon_ids>`,
      for which value is irrelevant.
    - **counts** (integer array): *Optional.* Number of timestamps counted by each
      record ID. If present, must be of the same length as ``id``.


For more info see :ref:`Group /setup/detectors<setup_detectors_group>`.

.. _optional_setup_fields:

Optional /setup fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following ``/setup`` fields are optional and not necessarily relevant for
all experiments. These fields may be not present when the associated
information is irrelevant or not available.

The following fields are arrays, one element per excitation source,
in the order of increasing wavelengths:

- **excitation_wavelengths**: (float array) list of excitation wavelengths
  (center wavelength if broad-band) in increasing order (unit: *meter*).

- **laser_repetition_rates**: (float array)  *New in version 0.5.*
  The laser repetition rate in Hz for each excitation source.

  a value of 0 in this field.

- **excitation_polarizations**: (float arrays) list of polarization
  angles (in degrees) for each excitation source.

- **detection_split_ch_ratios**: (float array) power fraction detected
  by each "beam-split" channel (i.e. independent detection channels
  obtained through a non-polarizing beam splitter). For 2 beam-split
  channels that receive the same power this array should be ``[0.5, 0.5]``.
  The first element refers to ``detectors_specs/split_ch1``, the second to
  ``detectors_specs/split_ch2`` and so on.
  This field is not relevant when no polarization- and spectral-insensitive
  splitting is performed.

- **author_affiliation**: (string) the company or institution the *author*
  is affiliated with.

- **creator**: (string) the Photon-HDF5 file creator. Used when the data

.. _provenance_group:

Provenance group
----------------

The **provenance/** group contains info about the original file that has
been converted into a Photon-HDF5 file.
If the file is directly saved to Photon-HDF5 there is no previous "original"
file and in this case the provenance group may be omitted.
Also, if some information is not available the relative field may be omitted.

- **filename**: (string) File name of the original data file before conversion to Photon-HDF5.

- **software**: (string) Software used to save the original data file.
- **software_version**: (string) Version of the software used to save the original data file.

.. _user_group:

User group
----------

The ``/user/`` group is reserved for user defined fields.
There are no specific definitions for the groups contained within ``/user/``.
Nor will standard readers of *photon-HDF5* files use any fields withing this group.

This group is intended to be used to store data not covered by the official photon-HDF5
specification. While there is not required format for this group, some suggestions are
provided, most notably the :ref:`experimental_settings/ <exp_settings>` group.

If the data is being converted from a format like .ptu from picoquant or .spc from
Beckr&Hickl, some metadata stored in the file is not included in the official photon-HDF5
specification. This metadata should be stored in a group named by the company manufacturing
the original data file (i.e. ``picoquant`` for .ptu files, ``becker_hickl`` for .spc files).

The ``user`` group can also be used to store results of various type of analysis.
Such data should be stored in a sub-group named according to the software used
for such analysis.
For instance, FRETBursts, if directed to do so, will save results of burst
analysis under the group ``/user/FRETBursts``.

.. _exp_settings:

Experimental Settings User Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is often desirable to store additional information and/or explanation of the experiment.
These fields should be values that are not know *a priori* before the measurement, or
which may have ambiguous definitions or unclear provenance.
Such information is best stored in a ``/user/experimental_settings/`` group. All information in this
group should be stored in a way that is self-explanatory, with human-readable details included.

If :ref:`non-photon IDs<non_photon_ids>` are included in
``/photon_data/detectors``, ``/user/experimental_settings/`` should contain the
group ``non_photon_id/`` with strings named ``id1``, ``id2`` ... which contain
human-readable explanations of the role of each :ref:`non-photon IDs<non_photon_ids>`
group of detectors (numbered identically. Additional explanation can be included as
a human readable string named ``non_photon_id_explanation``.


FRET correction factors can be stored within ``/user/experimental_settings/``,
each should contain 1 element per `photon_dataN`` group:

- **gamma** (float or float array) The gamma correction factor, correcting for differences
  in detection efficiency and fluorophore brightness between donor and acceptor.
- **beta** (float or float array) The beta correction factor, correcting for differences
  in donor and acceptor excitation.
- **direct_excitation** (float or float array) the direct excitation fraction, accounting for
  the fraction of acceptor directly excited by donor laser.
- **leakage** (float or float array) the leakage factor accounting for the
- **fret_provenance** (string) a human readable string defining how the FRET correction
  factors were determined and a doi to the definition used for the correction factors.
  We suggest the following ``https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0085-0``
  (`Hellenkamp et. al. 2018 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0085-0>`_)

.. note::
    If any FRET correction factor is stored, the ``fret_provenance`` field
    should also be included so that users will know how to apply the supplied
    correction factors correctly.

Additional fields are suggested for storing information about each detector's
(ie instruments that generate photon IDs) background and afterpulsing characteristics:

- **dcr** (float array): *Optional.* Dark counting rate in Hz for each pixel.
  If present, must be of the same length as ``id``.
  This value should be 0 for positions corresponding to 0 for marker IDs.
- **dcr_provenance** (string) Human readable description for how the dcr was determined.
- **afterpulsing** (float array): *Optional.* Afterpulsing probability
  for each record ID. If present, must be of the same length as ``id``.
  This value should be 0 for positions corresponding to 0 for non-photon IDs.
- **afterpulsing_provenance** (string) Human readable description for how the
  afterpulsing was determined.

In general, the method for determining any value in ``/user/experimental_settings/`` should
be specified as a string in a ``[value]_provenance`` group.

See <link to notebook to be created> for an example of how to use the */user/experimental_settings/**
group.

Additional notes and definitions
--------------------------------

.. _detector_ids:

Detector IDs
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *detector ID* is the "name" for each type of event recorded in ``/photon_data/detectors``.
These are divided into two broad types: "photon IDs" and "non-photon IDs".
In previous versions only photon IDs were handled, and were also referred to as pixel IDs;

A "non-photon ID" is any other type of event (e.g. sync signal, FLIM marker) recorded
in the original source file/by the TCSPC card.

Detectors IDs are usually a single integer.
Detectors are normally numbered incrementally, but are not required to be.
In other words, a file containing data taken with 2 single-point detectors could have
the first detector labeled "4" and the second detector labeled "6".
In some cases (when using detector arrays) the record ID
can be a *n*-tuple of integers. This allow to specify, for each pixel,
the module number and the X, Y location, for example. Therefore, an
array of record IDs can be either a 1-D column array or a 2-D array.
In either case, each row identifies a record.

.. _non_photon_ids:

Non-Photon IDs
""""""""""""""

If the acquisition software also records events such as sync signals or markers indicating
a change in position of a piezo or galvo scanner, these events should also be assigned a unique
pixel ID. These events are all considered markers. To distinguish between detector (i.e. real photons)
and marker IDs, the record IDs of marker events must be recorded in one of the ``non_photon_ch1``,
``non_photon_ch2`` ... groups within ``/photon_data/measurement_specs/detectors_specs`` group.
In photon-HDF5 v0.5 no additional information is officially recorded, and thus it is recommended
to store a description of the meaning of each type of marker ID in the ``user/experimental_settings``
group. See :ref:`user_group` to understand how to use this group.


.. note::

    Inclusion of non-photon ids is discouraged for <v0.5 compatibility reasons.
    Please include only if necessary, otherwise filter these events out of the
    data before saving the photon-HDF5 file.

.. _beam_split_ch:

Beam-split channels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the emitted light path is split in 2 or more detection paths by using
a non-polarizing beam splitter the measurement has so called
beam-split channels. The fields ``split_ch1``, ``split_ch2`` ... contain
the list of :ref:`detector IDs<detector_ids>` for each beam-split channel
(see :ref:`detectors_specs_group`).

Beam split channels can receive same or different (depending on whether the
beam splitter is 50-50). The fractional power of each beam split channel
can be saved in the field ``detection_split_ch_ratios`` in
the :ref:`/setup/ group<setup_group>`.


.. _wavelengths_order:

Wavelengths and spectral-band order
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Photon-HDF5, by convention, all the excitation wavelengths and detection
spectral bands are ordered in increasing order: from the shortest to the
longest wavelength. This ordering is strictly followed and removes any
ambiguity in defining first, second, etc... wavelength or spectral band.

For examples, for μs-ALEX and ns-ALEX (or PIE) the excitation wavelengths
(in ``/setup/excitation_wavelengths``) are ordered as

1. *donor excitation wavelength*,
2. *acceptor excitation wavelength*

Similarly, the donor (or acceptor) excitation period range is defined by
``/photon_data/measurement_specs/alex_excitation_period1``
(or ``/photon_data/measurement_specs/alex_excitation_period2``).

Finally the donor (or acceptor) :ref:`detector IDs<detector_ids>` number is defined in
``/photon_data/measurement_specs/detectors_specs/spectral_ch1``
(or ``/photon_data/measurement_specs/detectors_specs/spectral_ch2``).


.. _alex_period_def:

Definition of alternation periods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note for μs-ALEX
""""""""""""""""

The fields ``alex_offset``, ``alex_excitation_period1`` and ``alex_excitation_period2``
define the excitation period for each excitation source. The alternation
histogram is the histogram of the following quantity:

``A`` = (``timestamps`` - ``alex_offset``) **MODULO** ``alex_period``

Note that ``alex_offset`` must be a value that shifts the timestamps in a way
that the resulting alternation histogram has uninterrupted excitation periods
for each excitation source. It can be thought as the delay between the start
of the timestamping and the start of the alternation modulation.
In most cases this is just an empirical parameter depending on the
specific setup.

Photons emitted during the donor period (or, respectively, acceptor
period) are obtained by applying the condition:

-  ``(A >= start) and (A < stop)``

.. _measurement_type:

Measurement type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each *measurement_type* has an associated set of mandatory fields
which must be present to ensure that all information needed to
unambiguously interpret the data is present.
For example, for a 2-color smFRET measurement, a software package creating
a file should check that the association between detector ID (previously called pixel) and donor or acceptor channel
is present.

The list of supported measurement types is reported in :ref:`measurement_specs_group`.

.. toctree::

    generic


.. _nanotimes_time_axis:

Nanotimes time direction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In typical TCSPC measurement the *start* and *stop* inputs are inverted,
i.e. the *start* is triggered by the photon and the *stop* by the the laser sync.
This allows to start TAC or TDC measurements only when a photon is
detected and not after each laser sync pulse. However, due to this experimental
configuration, the resulting raw TCSPC histogram looks inverted along the time axis,
with the nanotimes of photons emitted shortly after a laser pulse being larger than
the nanotimes of photons emitted much later.

By convention, the Photon-HDF5 format requires nanotimes to be properly oriented.
In other words, when a ``/photon_data/nanotimes`` time axis inversion is needed,
this correction needs to be performed before the data is saved into a Photon-HDF5 file.
As a corollary, TCSPC histograms computed directly from ``nanotimes`` from Photon-HDF5
files are always properly oriented, regardless of the way the nanotimes were acquired.


.. _setup_detectors_group:

Group /setup/detectors/
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This group is new in version 0.5 and contains fields which are arrays, one
element per detector ID (both photon and non-photon) (see :ref:`definition<detectors_group>`).
The only mandatory field is ``id`` which contains
all detectors IDs as they appear in ``/photon_data/detectors``.
Within each spot, IDs appear in ``/setup/detectors/id`` in increasing order.
All values which appears in ``/photon_data/detectors`` need to be listed here.
Note that while v0.5 now has soft-support for non-photon IDs, supporting such events
as markers for FLIM, sync signals from the TCSPC card, signals for monitoring laser
power etc. overflow markers such as those present in many Picoquant formats must
be removed.

In TCSPC measurements where each detector (pixel) has different TCSPC bin width,
the ``/setup/detectors`` group allows to save per-photon detector TCSPC info.
In this case the the
``nanotimes_specs`` group is not present in ``photon_data`` and the group
``/setup/detectors`` will contain per-photon detector TCSPC info::

    /setup/detectors/tcspc_units
    /setup/detectors/tcspc_num_bins


.. _multi_spot:

Multi-spot measurements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multi-spot measurements are simply handled by having multiple ``photon_data``
groups, one for each excitation spot. The naming convention is the following::

    photon_data0
    photon_data1
    ...
    photon_data10
    ...
    photon_data100

Note that the enumeration starts from zero and there is no zero filling.
Each ``photon_dataN`` group will have a complete ``measurement_specs``
sub-group so that it can effectively treated as a single-spot measurements
when reading the file.
As a result, even if the ``measurement_type`` field is not expected to change
for different spots, it will be replicated inside each ``photon_dataN``
group.

In version 0.5 and above the ``/photon_dataNN/detectors`` arrays need to
contain detectors identifier which are unique across all the spots. In version
0.4 the same identifiers (e.g. 0 and 1) were allowed in different spots.
