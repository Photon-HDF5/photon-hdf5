.. _version0.5:

What changed in version 0.5
===========================

- A new measurement_type "generic" was added. In a "generic" measurement, the
  specifications are determined by the fields in the ``/setup`` group.
  For details see :doc:`generic`.

- A new field: ``/setup/excitation_alternated`` (array of booleans), was added, which is True
  for all excitation sources which are intensity-modulated.
  This field allows distinguishing between ALEX and PAX measurements (i.e.
  when only one laser is alternated).

- A New group: ``/setup/detectors`` containing arrays of per-pixel information, was added.
  See :ref:`setup_detectors_group`.

- Introduction of limited support for markers :ref:`non_photon_ids`, allowing sync, markers for FLIM,
  sync signals etc. to be included. Currently the meaning of these ids is left to the user. In
  upcoming release of v0.6, support for basic raster-scan FLIM will be introduced, where markers
  can optionally be used to specify the beginning of pixels/lines/frames.

- Support was added for cases where TCSPC specifications change for each pixel, by addition of
  dedicated fields in ``/setup/detectors``.
  See :ref:`Group /setup/detectors <setup_detectors_group>`.
